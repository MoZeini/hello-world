# Project: Bay Area Bike Share Analysis
## Data Analysis

To see the project refer to `Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb` file.

### Overview

[Bay Area Bike Share[(http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/) is a company that provides on-demand bike rentals for customers in San Francisco, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Mountain View, and San Jose. Users can unlock bikes from a variety of stations throughout each city, and return them to any station within the same city. Users pay for the service either through a yearly subscription or by purchasing 3-day or 24-hour passes. Users can make an unlimited number of trips, with trips under thirty minutes in length having no additional charge; longer trips will incur overtime fees.

In this project, we will perform an exploratory analysis on the data. we will take a look at two of the major parts of the data analysis process: data wrangling and exploratory data analysis. But before start looking at data, we discuss some questions we might want to understand about the bike share data. Consider, for example, if we were working for Bay Area Bike Share: what kinds of information would we want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? Or we might think about if we were a user of the bike share service. What factors might influence how we would want to use the service?

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer. 

### Code

The code is provided in the `Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb` notebook file. The data files are in `dandp0-bikeshareanalysis.zip` file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Udacity-P1-Analyze-Bay-Area-Bike-Share-Data/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
